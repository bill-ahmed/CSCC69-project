    Each time there is a write that would extend the length of a file,
    we break up the write into one block at a time. This way no one
    file can hog the resources or allocate itself the entire disk
    blocking out other processes also trying to write data to the disk. 

    The problem of two processes trying to extend their files at the
    same time becomes straight forward to handle once what is explained
    above is implemented. Since each user write is handled one block at
    a time, if thread A needs to write to many many sectors, and at the
    same time thread B only needs to write to one, then at the time
    thread B is executing, it won't be blocked from grabbing a block to
    write to, even if A is in the middle of trying to write many blocks
    during it's write syscall.

    There are two cases that would happen with our code, which depends
    on which process is executing at the time of thier intended operation.

    If A gets there first and sees no lock on that block, then it will 
    read, see the EOF, and return having read "nothing". Then process B 
    will be free to write and aquire the modification lock. The modification
    lock will only stop other processes from *starting* a read/write, but
    won't stop a reader from reading if it was already doing so at the time
    another process aquires the modification lock. So if A starts a read
    and then is interupted, and B aquires the lock and writes to that block.
    Remember that the modification lock is per block so that the write call
    doesn't gate other processes from reading entirely.
    
    If B gets there first and intends to write, it sets a lock on that
    block and writes whatever data to that block and unlocks it 
    afterwards. Like above, the other reading processes can read it
    still as they would normally be able to do.

    Is it fair because only one block per process is ever locked down for
    modification at one time. This allows other readers to still have full
    access to read from other areas of the file during a write.

    The inode structure we use is 10 direct block pointers, 1 indirect block
    pointer, and 1 double-indirect block pointer. We feel this gives a good
    balance between speedy access to smaller files while still supporting
    file sizes up to about 8MB (plus whatever overhead is involved with storing
    indirect blocks) by having one double-indirect block.

               SURVEY QUESTIONS
               ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
